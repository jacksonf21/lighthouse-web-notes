## Lesson Notes

Tabbing can complete for CLI with a prefix

Markdown is like html 
- you can view markdowns in vscode by the preview button in the top right

Command Line Arguments in Node JS.
- you can pass arguments/their properties into node to return values
- process.argv is a native array that registers all arguments passed in
	- first and second parameters are always
		1. path to node executable
		2. path to script 

console.assert => allows testing of functions with operators/expected values

Hoisting
- When declaring variables not at the top of your scripts, any references to those variables prior to the actual declaration results in either error or undefined due to hoisting of the variable occuring, but not the setting of the value since it precedes the actual line of setting the value

VIM

There are two key modes for VIM
1. command => uses key commands 
2. insert => enter into the field of text

### Instructor Questions
How would you write the assignments?

Why would you need to do a double nest of backticks ie nested backticks?

reverse.js -
- variable declarations should be obvious
- code should be simple, readable, and maintainable
  -simple:	 less lines the better
  -readable: 	 var declarations, comments
  -maintainable:
